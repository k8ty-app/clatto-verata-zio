The service module pattern is a helpful pattern that you will use as you build your applications with ZIO. There are two
versions of this pattern - and both are now documented [here](/docs/zio/service_module_pattern). Both are valid to use -
but if you're starting out a new project with ZIO - and want an easy path to upgrade to ZIO 2.0 - use the second
pattern.
