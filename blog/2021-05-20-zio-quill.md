While the official `zio-sql` project is still in its early experimental phase - what is someone who is building
new applications or services with ZIO supposed to use?  Fortunately the creator of the awesome Quill library has added
a `zio-quill` module!  We've provided a simple example of how this all comes together.  A more advanced 'how you would do this for real in production'
example if forthcoming!  Give [Quill](https://getquill.io) a look if you haven't already.  In the meantime, take a gander
at our [General Usage](/docs/zio-quill/general) example to get a sense if it will work for your project!
