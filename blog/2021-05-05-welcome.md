ðŸ‘‹ Hello, there!

<!--truncate-->

Welcome to CVZ Examples! It's meant to be community-lead example driven ZIO documentation site that uses mdoc to
generate typechecked markdown documentation for Scala. Currently, it's a site... so we just need community (that's YOU!)
and documentation! ðŸ¤£

Head over to the [docs](/docs/intro) landing page to get a quick rundown for how the site tooling is set up, if you are looking to
contribute.

The site was just set up, so many examples I have as snippets need to be added in - so it's slim today, but check back
soon! Also, hopefully I'll get the stock Docusaurus graphics replaced soon! Silly pictures contributions are welcomed ðŸ™‚
