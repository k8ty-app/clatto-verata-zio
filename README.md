# Clatto... Verata... ZIO!

This site is meant to be a community-lead example driven [ZIO](https://zio.dev) documentation site. It
uses [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/) to generate typechecked markdown documentation for Scala.

All are welcome to contribute some thoughtful/real-world examples of how to use ZIO straightforwardly, and provide the
community an extra resource that might live outside the official documentation.

For documentation, see [here](./mdocs/intro.md)
