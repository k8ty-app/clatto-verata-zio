# About

This site is meant to be a community-lead example driven [ZIO](https://zio.dev) documentation site. It
uses [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/) to generate typechecked markdown documentation for Scala.

All are welcome to contribute some thoughtful/real-world examples of how to use ZIO straightforwardly, and provide the
community an extra resource that might live outside the official documentation.

## What's with the weird name?

The site's name is a play on the movie Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness and the [Zionomicon](https://www.zionomicon.com/)
. In the movie, before removing the Necronomicon from its sanctuary to stop the rise of the Army of Darkness, Ash must
say the phrase

> Clatto Verata Nicto

Things... don't go exactly as planned, and to summarize with a dialogue quote from the movie:
> WISEMAN JOHN: When you removed the Necronomicon from it's cradle, did you speak the words?

> ASH: Yeah. basically.

> WISEMAN JOHN: Did you speak the exact words?!

> ASH: Well, maybe not every single syllable, no. But basically I said them. Yes.

and if that's not an allegory for why my code won't compile, I don't know what is ðŸ¤£

### That's not what he said

The phrase is actually a reference to the quote `Klaatu Barada Nikto` in the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still.
It seems like in AoD they changed it to `Clatto Verata Nicto`, but it sounds quite similar to the original. 

I like to think that the different version fits better with the theme ðŸ™ƒ
